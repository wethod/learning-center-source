## Overview

Here you can see the value of your [projects](http://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#projects) for each month of the current year.

The monthly distribution is achieved by looking at the [production plan](http://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#production-plan) of every project, for example: if a project is evaluated 10 K with 3 K planned to be produced in January and 7 K planned to be produced in February, the value of this project will contribute with 3 K to the January's revenues and with 7 K to February's revenues.

Four important indicators are given in the first three rows:

* **Total**: the sum of all your projects' revenues, per month;
* [**Bluesky**](http://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#bluesky): here you can insert, for each month, the value (in K) you think is missing from the total to reach the expected revenues. For example: January's total is 2 K but you're sure you will invoice 5 K in the same month by the end of the year, just add a Bluesky of 3 K to adjust your revenues;
* **Delta revenue target**: this is the [revenues target](/revenues/index/#revenues-target) by month, that is the difference (by client) between month's target and month's revenues. A month's target is calculated by distributing the quarter's target on the remaining non-past months. A past month's delta revenue target is **zero** because it's a forecast, and a forecast in the past makes no sense.
* **Revenues**: revenues without bluesky, per month.
