## Expenses

*Projects > Wallet > Expenses*

The expense reimbursement process allows employers to pay back employees who have spent their own money for business-related expenses. These types of reimbursable expenses tend to occur when employees travel for work, but can be associated with other activities related to their employment, including, for example, certain purchases of work-related supplies or tools.

![](/uploads/2022/08/30/expenses-list.png)

All expenses are listed with the following information at display:

* Job order category badge
* Category of expense
* Requested by
* Project
* Date
* Notes
* Reimbursement value (always expressed in master currency)

Based on [permission roles](/settings/index/#permissions), users can view, edit, delete their own expenses and/or others' expenses.

Users with permission to edit others' expenses can also change the owner of the expense when creating or updating it from the sidebar details.

{{< /note >}}

### Type of reimbursement

* **Flat-rate**: whether the type of reimbursement is a fixed value (expressed in the reimbursement *value* field, required), regardless the value of the expense. *i.e. Acme Inc. refunds each employee 12 for a lunch.

* **Mileage/Km**: whether the type of reimbursement is a fixed value (expressed in the reimbursement *value* field, required) per mile or kilometer declared by the employee. *i.e. Acme Inc. refunds 0,40 for each km travelled.

* **Total**: whether the employer refunds the whole expense declared by the employee. *i.e. Acme Inc. refunds the total cost of a taxi trip. Wendy, in her business travel for Acme,took a taxi from London Victoria train station to the City and spent 30. Wendy will be refunded 30.*
* **Total (max value)**: whether the employer refunds the whole expense until a maximum refund value (expressed in the *reimbursement value* field, required) is reached. *i.e. Acme Inc. refunds the total cost of a dinner up to 30. Britney, an account manager at Acme, had a business dinner with her clients  and spent 250. Britney will be refunded 30.*
* **Quantity**: whether the employer refunds a fixed value per unit. *i.e. Acme Inc. refunds the 0,10 for each marker bought by an employee. Jason, a UX designer at Acme, bought 20 markers for a design workshop he conducted with a client. Jason will be refunded 2.*
