## Warm Up

Visit [app.wethod.com/registration](https://app.wethod.com/registration) to create your team and get a 14 days free trial, we don't force you to insert a credit card and you can take advantage of our tutorial.

## Setup Your Company

By clicking on your initials (in the top right corner), the **Settings** menu will be shown and you can select the [Company](/settings/index/#company) section to configure your team.

Now you can invite your team members by visiting the **Team** section.

Here we are, you are ready to start!

## The Workflow

1. Add a project to your [Pipeline](/pipeline/index/);

2. Provide a [Budget](/budget/index/) for the project;

3. Assign people to the project by using the [Planning](/planning/index/);

4. Every Friday an e-mail will remind:

   1. Each project manager to compile the [Project Status](/friday/index/#project-status) for its projects;

   2. Each collaborator to compile the [Timesheet](/friday/index/#timesheet) for the projects he worked on.

When you want to check the status of your projects, just visit the [Reports](/reports/index/) section: we take care of aggregating the data for you, just sit down and get ready to feel the power of knowledge.

The beating heart of WETHOD is the [Dashboard](/dashboard/index/): a customizable set of widgets that you can use to be constantly updated on the relevant information about the projects that you care about the most.
