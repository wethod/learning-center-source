## Activities

This box collects all the items that were assigned to you in any [boards](/pipeline/index/#boards). You can scroll through them, search by item name and mark them as completed without going to the dedicated page. If this box is empty try to add a column "Member" in a board and set yourself as "Activity's assignee"
