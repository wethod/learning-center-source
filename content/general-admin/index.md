## Overview

In this page, you’ll find a table where you can define and manage all **General & Administrative (G\&A) costs**, providing an aggregated view of expenses such as **administrative fees, IT services, and office expenses**.
There are two ways to input Company G\&A Costs;

1\. **Use the G\&A cost table**
This option allows you to manage G\&A costs directly from the settings without creating orders or project tasks (commesse). Here’s how:

* Add a new row in the table.
* Provide the following details:
  * Name of the cost
  * Start month and end month
  * Yearly cost amount
  * Business unit to associate the cost (optional)
    Once you input these details, the system will automatically distribute the total cost across the relevant months, and associate the cost with the specified business unit if provided.

2\. **Manage G\&A costs through a project**
If you prefer to track marketing costs by recording them monthly through orders with specific suppliers, you can manage them via a dedicated project.

To set it up, create a project dedicated to G\&A costs, and ensure that the job order category associated with this project links external costs to the G\&A category.
The table will automatically display the total of all forecasted and actual G\&A costs recorded throughout the year for that project. This provides a detailed, real-time view of your G\&A expenses from a project-based perspective.
