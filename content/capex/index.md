## Overview

This section provides an overview of all investment projects values meant as Capital Expenditures. 

{{< img-center src="/uploads/2018/11/23/support_capex.png" >}}

Total CapEx costs for each project are divided into:

* **Payroll costs**: all the costs derived from employees’ levels’ rates 
* **External costs** 

You can edit the _CapEx percentage_ field to tell Wethod the amount of investment to consider from the project.

To mark all costs in a project as CapEx, just assign that project a [job order category](http://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company) where "CapEx" is flagged
