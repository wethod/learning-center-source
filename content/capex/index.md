## Overview

This section provides an overview of all investment project values meant as Capital Expenditures.

Total CapEx costs for each project are divided into:

* **Payroll costs**: all the costs derived from employees’ levels’ rates 
* **External costs** 

You can edit the _CapEx percentage_ field to tell Wethod the amount of investment to consider from the project.

To mark all costs in a project as CapEx, just assign that project a [job order category](http://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company) where "CapEx" is flagged
