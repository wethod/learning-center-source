## Overview

From here you can see the invoice plans of all your company's projects.

This is basically a summary of the view you have from [pipeline](/pipeline/index#invoice-plan), where you can access each project's invoice plan one by one.

Each row in this view represents a project and carries with it a bunch of information:

* Whether the plan is automatically or manually distributed
* Name and client for the project
* The monthly plan's distribution for the current year: for each month you can appreciate the plan's value and the actual invoices amount (colored with lower opacity)
* The total plan's amount for the current year
