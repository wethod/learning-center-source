## Overview

In this page, you’ll find a table where you can define and manage all General & Administrative (G\&A) costs, providing an aggregated view of expenses such as administrative fees, IT services, and office expenses.

There are two ways to input Company G\&A Costs;

1\. Use the G\&A Cost Table

This option allows you to manage G\&A costs directly from the settings without creating orders or project tasks (commesse). Here’s how:

&#x9;•	Add a new row in the table.

&#x9;•	Provide the following details:

&#x9;•	Name of the cost

&#x9;•	Start month and end month

&#x9;•	Yearly cost amount

&#x9;•	(Optional) Business unit to associate the cost

Automatic Calculation:

Once you input these details, the system will automatically:

&#x9;•	Distribute the total cost across the relevant months.

&#x9;•	Associate the cost with the specified business unit if provided.

2\. Manage G\&A Costs through a Project (Commessa)

If you prefer to track G\&A costs through a project and record them monthly via orders with specific suppliers, you can manage them via a dedicated project (commessa).

How to set it up:

• Create a project specifically for G\&A costs.

• In Geporter Categories, ensure the job order category associated with this project links external costs to the G\&A Cost category.

What you’ll see:

The table will automatically display the total of all forecasted and actual G\&A costs recorded throughout the year for that project. This provides a detailed, real-time view of your G\&A expenses from a project-based perspective.
